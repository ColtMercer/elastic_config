    "# Elastic Training with Kabana\n",
    "This training material is to familiarize you with the Elastic Search Queries using Kibana and the Elastic API. The dataset used in this training is the collection of all Stehpen King Novels downloaded from Kaggle. The training will be used to answer 10 trivia questions about Stephen King Novels using advanced search queries in Kibana and via API. Each question will be answered showing how to find answer using Kibana UI, Python Requests, Python ElasticSearch Client and converting the query response to a pandas dataframe.\n",

    "## Challenge:\n",
    "Once famialr with the Elastic Search queries, I recommend downloading the Harry Potter books from Kaggle and try to answer your own trivia questions using Elastic Search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sets:\n",
    "Stephen King Novels: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lujar1762/stephen-king-books\n",
    "Harry Potter Books: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moxxis/harry-potter-lstm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment:\n",
    "The source code will build a docker environment with the following containers:\n",
    "- 3 x ElasticSearch Indexer Nodes\n",
    "- 1 x Kibana (Elastic UI and Visualization Tool)\n",
    "- 1 x MongoDB Server\n",
    "- 1 x MondoDB Express Server\n",
    "- 1 x Python container that will create the data set and adding to elastic indexers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "1. Install Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)\n",
    "  - https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop\n",
    "2. Clone the repository\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <repo url>\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Run the following command to build the environment\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose up -d\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Open Kibana in your browser: http://localhost:5601\n",
    "```note\n",
    "Default credentials for elastic API\n",
    "  - Username: elastic\n",
    "  - Password: changeme\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Open MongoDB Express in your browser: http://localhost:8081 (This trainging will not cover MongoDB)\n",
    "```note\n",
    "Credentials Set in the docker-compose.yml file\n",
    "  - Username: devuser\n",
    "  - Password: devpasswd\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Open Jupyter Notebook using your preferred method\n",
    "7. Install the required python packages\n",
    "Using pip\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "using conda\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install --file requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "If data is not created, check the logs of the data_creator container. It may be that the data is not being created because the elasticsearch container is not ready yet. In that case, restart the data_creator container. There are sleep timers to minimize but slower computers may need to increase the sleep timers."
